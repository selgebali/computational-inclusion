# Computational-Inclusion
This resource is a list of tools and advice to increase inclusion in computational settings such as training events and workshops.

Group: Sara El-Gebali and Offray Vladimir Luna

This project is an extension of the initial list of Do's and Don’ts in computational training, see Sara's [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/selgebali/CCMcr19_dos). The aim of this resource is to provide a compilation of advice, good practices, and tools collected from trainers and students in computational training events around the globe. 

The first edition of the list of Do's and Dont's was created with the input of Carpentry trainers during the [Carpentry Connect Manchester 2019](https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19). 

This edition is a joint effort by Sara and Offray during the [eLife Sprint 2019 in Cambridge UK (Sept, 4-5)](https://sprint.elifesciences.org/).

This is part of an ongoing effort that aims to showcase and map the diversity of helpful approaches in computational training practices on a global scale.

You might find similarities with resources such as the Awesome list, which is a diverse and eclectic list, providing introductory points to several other technologies, learning materials, communities and practices that are related to computational training, and it also provides a broad overview of what is being done in that front.

This resource provides advice and solutions for computational training events.
